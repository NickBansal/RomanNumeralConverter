# Roman numeral converter
This is my roman numeral converter written in Javascript and completed using Node JS with tested using Jest.

Here I used a TDD approach writing tests for each case and then writing code to make the test pass.

The assumptions I made were that any values passed into the convert function are whole numbers and the values could only lie between the range 1 - 3999
